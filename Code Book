Description of Data.txt according to the guidelines detailed in the task.

Data to variables:
ft <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

act <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
Activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column

x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns

y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
Test data of activities’code labels

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column

x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns


y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create df1:
X (10299 rows, 561 columns): created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column): created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject (10299 rows, 1 column): created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
df1 (10299 rows, 563 column): created by merging subject, Y and X using cbind() function

2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
df2 (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting df1 and selecting columns "subject", "code" and the measurements on the mean and SD

3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4) Entire numbers in code column of the df2 replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable:
-All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
-All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
-All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
-All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
-All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
-All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5) Fromdf3 the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
data (180 rows, 88 columns) is a sumarize of df2 with the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, group by subject and activity.
df3 is exported into data.txt file.
